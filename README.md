## Overview of the Student Management System Project
The Student Management System is a C++ program designed to streamline the process of managing student records. It allows users to add, view, edit, and delete student information efficiently. Additionally, the system automatically calculates grades based on the students' marks, making it a practical solution for small-scale educational management.

## Key Features
Student Registration:

Add new student records with unique IDs, names, and marks for multiple subjects.
Grade Calculation:

Automatically calculates the grade for each student based on their average marks using a predefined grading scale:
A: 90 and above
B: 80 to 89
C: 70 to 79
D: 60 to 69
F: Below 60
Record Management:

Display Students: View all student records in a tabular format, including their ID, name, and grade.
Edit Records: Modify student information, including their name, marks, and grades.
Delete Records: Remove student records by specifying their unique ID.
Interactive Menu:

A user-friendly menu-driven interface for seamless navigation through various operations.
Components of the System
Student Struct:

A struct holds the details of each student:
ID: Unique identifier for the student.
Name: Full name of the student.
Marks: A vector to store marks for multiple subjects.
Grade: A character representing the student's grade.
Functionality:

Add Student: Collects student details and calculates the grade automatically.
Display Students: Outputs all student records in an organized format.
Edit Student: Allows modification of a student's details, recalculating grades as needed.
Delete Student: Erases a student's record based on their ID.
Grade Calculator:

Computes the grade by averaging the marks and applying a grading scale.
How It Works
The program begins with a menu offering options to add, view, edit, or delete student records.
The user selects an option:
Add Student: Enter the ID, name, and marks for subjects. The system calculates the grade automatically.
View Students: Displays all records in a tabular format.
Edit Student: Updates details of a specific student using their unique ID.
Delete Student: Removes a student record permanently.
The user can repeat these actions until they choose to exit the system.
Project Benefits
Simplifies record management for educational institutions or small classes.
Ensures accuracy in grade calculation and record-keeping.
Provides an interactive, intuitive interface for users.
Potential Enhancements
Persistent Storage: Save and load student data from a file for long-term use.
Search Functionality: Add a feature to find students by ID or name.
Reporting: Generate detailed reports for all students, including individual performance summaries.
Authentication: Implement user login to secure the system from unauthorized access.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Upgrade to a GUI using libraries like Qt or SFML for better usability.
This project is an excellent demonstration of core C++ programming concepts, including structs, vectors, functions, and control structures, while providing a practical application.
